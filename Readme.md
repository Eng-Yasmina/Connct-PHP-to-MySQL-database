# ITI Students web app
using PHP, i connected to MySQL to send the data of each regesitred student the database and then retrieve the data from the database to present the users information in the home web page. I also added CRUD operations to the database to view the detailed information of the users and to be able to edit and update the info of each  user in the database and to be able to delete the user.



***Steps of how I have developed this Web app:***
1. I set up the server and conncted PHP to MySQL database.
2. I created a new database and a new table fot the users.
3. I created a form page for each user to register and created an index page to display the users details.
4. I added CRUD operations to the database to view the detailed information of the users and to be able to edit and update the info of each  user in the database and to be able to delete the user.
